My name is Vivaan, and I am a junior at Lambert High School with a passion for engineering, specifically mechanical engineering. In my spare time, I like to build projects that involve engineering principles. I like to challenge myself with new challenges, whether it is recreating my favorite movie props, crafting items for video games, or designing something to solve a problem around the house. I created this portfolio to share some of my creations with the world -- maybe they will inspire you to build something of your own as well!
