My name is Vivaan, and I’m a junior at Lambert High School with a strong passion for engineering, especially mechanical engineering. When I’m not at school or working on homework, I love building projects that use engineering principles. Whether it’s recreating my favorite movie props, crafting video game items, or designing something to solve a problem around the house, I’m always hands-on with a new challenge. I created this portfolio to share some of my creations with the world—maybe they’ll inspire you to build something too!
