## About
This was my largest project by scale — a giant spider built as a Halloween decoration. Since my family doesn’t usually buy expensive decorations, I decided to make one myself. The design was inspired by a project from Wicked Makers on YouTube, but I customized and modified their approach to better fit my own design goals and materials.

## Body
The body frame is built from chicken wire, carefully shaped into separate head and body sections that were later joined together. To cover the sharp edges, the entire frame was wrapped in saran wrap before being coated with spray foam insulation. Once the foam cured, it was spray painted black using Flex Seal for added durability and weather resistance. The eyes and fangs were 3D printed from PLA for a clean, detailed finish. On the underside, eight PVC 90-degree connectors provide mounting points for the legs, allowing for sturdy attachment and easy disassembly.

## Leg Mechanism
Each leg is built from three segments of pipe insulation, joined together with wood glue for flexibility and strength. A 10-gauge metal wire runs through each leg to hold its shape, with custom 3D printed tips that complete the spider-like look. The wire extends slightly at the end, allowing the legs to anchor securely into the ground even in strong winds. On the opposite end, each leg connects to the body through a PVC joint that fits into a 90-degree PVC angle connector, making the whole setup easy to assemble and store after Halloween. In total, the spider has eight fully poseable legs.

## Electrical
Each eye of the spider is powered by a 3W white LED connected to a simple switch and a 2 AA battery pack mounted at the bottom. The lights can run for about seven hours before the batteries start to fade. The eyes themselves are 3D printed from transparent PLA, which creates a slightly translucent texture when printed on an FDM printer — exactly the look I was going for. Each eye also acts as a protective casing for the LED, keeping it safe from moisture and weather.
