title: "Project 1: Cardboard Minecraft Wolf"
excerpt: "'Minecraft' was my childhood favorite video game and I still play it today, and one of my favorite mechanics is the ability to tame a pet wolf. This was the first project I ever made, fully made of cardboard and hand-painted. It's not complex with any electronics, but it's very monumental since it began my love for engineering and building.
