title: "Cardboard Minecraft Wolf"
excerpt: "'Minecraft' was my childhood favorite video game and I still play it today, and one of my favorite mechanics is the ability to tame a pet wolf. So for my first project, I decided to bring it to life!

I've always loved videogames as a kid and still do, so it was only a matter of time until I built something from a videogame. One of my favorite video games of all time was "Minecraft". It's a sandbox game in a blocky format that let's you be creative in any way you want. One of the best mechanics is being able to tame a wolf and keep it as a pet, so I decided to build it in real life. This was the first project I ever made and it is what sparked my love for engineering and building. Made completely out of cardboard and hand painted, it doesn't have any complex electronics or circuitry, but it's still a monumental project.
