title: "Project 2: CO₂ Car"
excerpt: "We had a project in school to build a wooden car powered by a mini CO₂ canister, so my group and I built this. We had to create the car from a premade wooden piece and couldn't add any external wood to enhance it, which proved quite challenging. We modeled it after Formula 1 with the front wing and the back spoiler and added a coat of paint.
