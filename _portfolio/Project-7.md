## About
During my sophomore year, I teamed up with three friends to build a Halloween-themed chessboard with a spooky twist. The board measured 36×36 inches and was completely made from wood, with each piece hand-painted in a unique horror style. I helped design and assemble the board, making sure the structure was sturdy and the grid perfectly aligned. We spent days sanding, painting, and sealing everything for a clean finish. It was one of our most ambitious builds at the time, and seeing everyone enjoy playing on it made it all worth it.

## Details
The chessboard measures 36 × 36 inches and was constructed from standard plywood, which was sanded, primed, and hand-painted to create a durable playing surface. Each chess piece was designed, etched, and cut from thin MDF sheets using precision hand tools, while the bases were repurposed from scrap wood blocks available in the school workshop. Every piece was individually sketched and painted to represent a unique Halloween character, combining craftsmanship with creative design. The result was a fully functional, large-scale wooden chess set that blended artistic detail with practical fabrication techniques.
