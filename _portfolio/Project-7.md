As Halloween drew near during my sophomore year at high school, we were given a project to build something Halloween-themed. I and 3 other friends decided to build a chess board with a spooky and giant twist. This 36x36-inch monster is fully made from wood and each piece is hand painted. It was a very ambitious project at the time, but I'm very happy with the final result. Everybody had fun playing with it and it turned out as one of my favorite projects ever.
