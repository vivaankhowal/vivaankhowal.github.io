## About
I’ve loved video games for as long as I can remember, so it was only a matter of time before I tried to bring one to life. One of my all-time favorites is Minecraft—a sandbox world of endless creativity where you can build, explore, and tame wild creatures. One of its most charming features is the ability to befriend a wolf and keep it as a loyal companion, and that’s exactly what inspired my first real-world build.

This project—a life-size cardboard replica of the Minecraft wolf, fully hand-painted—was simple in concept but deeply meaningful. It had no electronics or moving parts, yet it became the project that sparked my passion for engineering and making things by hand.

## Details
The wolf measures 33 inches tall, 16 inches wide, and 48 inches long. It is constructed entirely from cardboard, with each panel hand-cut and painted to accurately replicate the in-game model. The internal framework consists of a reinforced grid structure, providing rigidity to prevent warping or collapse. The assembly is secured using hot glue for bonding and duct tape for additional joint reinforcement. While primarily designed as a static display model, the project emphasizes basic structural efficiency within simple material constraints.
