title: "Project 3: Neopixel Lightsaber"
excerpt: "This is the project I'm currently working on. It's a Kylo Ren-style Lightsaber with LED strips in the blade. It is easily my favorite project I've built so far, but also the hardest project yet. Although it isn't finished, it is turning out amazing so far.

This is my most recent project and is still in progress. It is an RGB LED "Neopixel" Lightsaber. I decided to build Kylo Ren's Lightsaber with the 2 mini-blades on the sides. The reason it's called a Neopixel Lightsaber is because the blades use a special type of LED strip that can be controlled with code. It's my favorite project so far, and also the hardest project I've attempted. This is my second time attempting this build because the first time I built it, it didn't look and work as well as I hoped, so I'm attempting it again and this time pouring a lot of effort into making it look good. So far it looks amazing.
