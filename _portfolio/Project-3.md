title: "Project 3: Infared LED Backdrop"
excerpt: "Our school was hosting a play and one of the parts of the backdrop was a giant LED sign for a backdrop, but before they spent money on LEDs, they needed someone to create a prototype controlled by an Infared remote. It was my first time using Infared, but I loved how it turned out. It has 6 different settings with 5 different colors.

Our school was hosting a play and they needed a giant LED sign shaped sort of like a lightning bolt with 3 Ws on the edges. It needed to be controlled remotely and be able to change to different modes with a click of a button, but before they bought the materials, they needed to make a prototype to see how they would set it up. Using my previous experience with RGB LED strips, I combined it with my newfound knowledge of Infared and created a remote control LED strip with 5 different colors and 6 different settings.
