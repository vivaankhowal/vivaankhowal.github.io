## About
This project might not be the most complex one I’ve built, but it’s easily one of the most refined. It’s a fully 3D-modeled and 3D-printed wall clock inspired by the design of a Formula 1 car wheel. I focused on achieving aesthetics, clean geometry, and precise tolerances to give it both visual appeal and functional reliability. As an F1 enthusiast, translating the sport’s engineering aesthetics into a timepiece made this one of my favorite design exercises.

## Design
The clock is completely 3D printed and powered by a simple quartz clock mechanism on the back, which runs on a single AA battery. It can be hung on a wall or placed on a flat surface using a custom stand I designed. The build includes 53 different 3D printed parts of all shapes and sizes, held together with very little glue and no screws. Almost every piece fits together perfectly through friction, making the assembly clean, simple, and satisfying.
