## About
This project isn't as impressive as my other builds, but it's one of the most well designed. It's a wall clock fully 3D printed and 3D modeled with inspiration taken from a Formula 1 Car wheel. As an avid F1 fan myself, this clock was super fun to CAD and design. The full clock is 3D printed and controlled using a simple Quartz Clock mechanism on the back.

## Design
Although it did technically work as a lightsaber, there were a lot of problems with it. Since everything was held with glue and tape, it wasn't nearly strong enough for any dueling and the cardboard hilt looked very makeshift and scrappy. None of the components were bolted down properly so you couldn't properly swing it without the fear of everything falling out. It was powered using a 9V Battery and since the LED strips were 5V, there was a constant risk of overheating and circuit damage (the saber would stay on for a minute max before the Arduino would heat up). The components were also too big to properly fit in the lightsaber hilt which also made it very bulky. There were a lot of problems with this version, but the important thing is there is a lot of room for improvement.
