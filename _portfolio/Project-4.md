## About
This is the first electrical project I attempted and also my favorite. It's a Neopixel Lightsaber with many colors and effects like the ones on the big screen. This originally started as a group project but after building the first version for the project, it didn't live up to the vision I had for this project. So I took it upon myself to rebuild it again and again so it matches my vision almost perfectly.
<p></p>
This was the first version that our group built for the project. It featured 2 WS2812b LED strips connected to an Arduino Nano via a breadboard with a momentary button, a 10,000 Ohm Resistor for control, and a 9V battery for power hooked up to a switch. For the hilt, everything was held with glue and tape, and a cardboard hilt as a base, Although it did light up, it was extremely delicate, and almost impossible to do certain things like swing it around or duel.
