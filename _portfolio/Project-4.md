This is my most recent project and is also my favorite. It is an RGB LED "Neopixel" Lightsaber. The reason it's called a Neopixel Lightsaber is because the blades use a special type of LED strip that can be controlled with code. It has a custom soundboard to play sounds when you swing it, it flashes when you clash it against something and can change color with a click of a button. This is the third version for this build because the first time I built it, it didn't look and work as well as I hoped, and the second version was better, but I felt like I could do better. so I attempted it again and this time poured a lot of effort into making it look good, and it turned out amazing.
