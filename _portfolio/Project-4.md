title: "Multi-purpose Robot Arm V1"
excerpt: "This was the hardest project I'd ever attempted, but also the coolest. I've always wanted a robot arm in my room but I could always use a ton of hands for different tasks, so why not build a robot that does it all?

## About 
Although this is the hardest project I've ever attempted, it also won me 2nd place at the Lanier Regional Tech Competition! It's a multipurpose robot arm where the head of the claw can be swapped out with these pre-made modules to complete different tasks. This is also the first project that could have some real-world potential in the industry. Imagine having a robot arm that can do multiple tasks instead of a robot for every task. It could save a lot of money and time! 

## CAD Design
For the 3D model, I used Onshape again to model every part, but this time not all the parts were designed by me. I found this youtube video that had a great design for a robot arm, and it provided the files for it as well. I used this design and slightly tweaked it to fit my needs.

The idea of the robot was good, but the overall design
