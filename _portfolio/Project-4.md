title: "Project 4: Infared LED Backdrop"
excerpt: "Our school was hosting a play and one of the parts of the backdrop was a giant LED sign shaped sort of like a lightning bolt with three Ws on it. But before they spent money on LEDs, they needed someone to create a prototype controlled by an Infared remote, so I agreed. It was my first time using Infared, but I loved how it turned out. It has 6 different settings with 5 different colors.
