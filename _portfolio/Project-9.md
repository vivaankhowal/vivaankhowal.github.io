## About
The Blitz RC Car is one of my most ambitious projects yet, featuring the most complex CAD design I’ve ever worked on. I started by studying a basic RC car model I found online and then heavily modified it to fit my own parts, dimensions, and performance goals. Every component from the suspension arms to the differential housing is being redesigned to improve strength, handling, and serviceability while keeping the build cost low.

This project is still a work in progress, with the main mission being to build the ultimate off-road RC car that’s fast, durable, and affordable. Nearly every part will be 3D printed (with the exception of the electronics), making it easy to repair or replace after testing. Beyond just building a fun RC car, my goal is to understand the mechanical systems that make real cars work—suspension geometry, drivetrain mechanics, steering systems, and torque distribution—and replicate them at a smaller scale through hands-on engineering and design.

## Hardware V1
The first version of the Blitz RC Car was built using Tarmo5 RC car parts, which helped me learn how RC cars are put together and how each system works. The main frame and suspension were 3D printed, and the car used 1/10 scale off-road wheels that gave it good traction and stability. Steering was handled by a strong 20 kg servo motor, which made the front wheels turn quickly and smoothly.

For power, the car used a 1450 KV brushless motor, a 60A speed controller, and a 3S LiPo battery, giving it solid speed and torque for testing. It was controlled with a basic RC transmitter and receiver, which kept things simple and reliable. This setup didn’t include any advanced features like a differential or telemetry, but it worked well enough to drive, test, and understand the basics of RC car performance. Building and running this version gave me a good foundation to start designing my own custom model for future versions.

Obviously I don't take any credit for the Tarmo5 design, so here is the link where I got the files:

## Hardware V2
The Blitz RC Car is being built from the ground up with performance and durability in mind. The main chassis, suspension, and body components will all be 3D printed using either PETG or carbon fiber nylon filament to achieve a balance of strength, flexibility, and impact resistance. The design focuses on modularity, making it easy to swap out or repair parts after testing.

Mechanically, the car will feature a full all-wheel drive (AWD) drivetrain with a limited slip differential to balance power between the front and rear wheels for improved traction on rough terrain. The suspension system will use oil-filled shocks for smoother handling and better control during jumps and uneven surfaces. Powering the car is a 3300 KV brushless motor paired with a waterproof 85A electronic speed controller (ESC) to handle high current loads while staying reliable in all weather conditions. Control comes from a transmitter and receiver combo equipped with smart telemetry, allowing real-time monitoring of motor temperature, battery voltage, and overall performance. Together, these components will make Blitz a tough, high-speed off-road RC car that blends advanced mechanics with a fully customizable, maker-friendly design.
