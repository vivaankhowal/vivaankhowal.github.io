## About
This is the second version I attempted all on my own. I took every aspect of the previous lightsaber and upgraded it in terms of durability, power, and looks. The electronics for this one feature an Arduino Nano instead of an Uno hooked up to 3 LED strips instead of 2 (One strip is for the side blades). For power, there is a 5V power bank with a much higher battery capacity and the matching voltage for the other electronics. It also features a custom LED button for ignition and a switch to turn the power bank on and off and actual soldering instead of heat shrinks. It also features a custom 3D-printed hilt instead of a cardboard one. Although it was a huge upgrade and was much tougher, it still wasn't as good as I wanted it to be and had a bunch of issues like being extremely heavy.

## Improvements
The hilt was way stronger than the previous version and could handle light hits and dueling. This time I used actual soldering instead of a breadboard with jumper wires for a much stronger connection. The button was a huge upgrade since the new one works a lot better and looks a lot better with the LED ring.

## Design Flaws
Although it was a lot sturdier than the previous version, there were many problems with it. The electronics inside were just stuffed together instead of having some organized structure, the different parts of the 3D printed hilt were held together with duct tape, and the biggest flaw was the saber was very heavy. Since there were 3 blades instead of one and it was powered by a 5V power bank, which is a lot heavier than a battery, the weight wasn't evenly distributed and it was extremely top-heavy.
