## About
This is the second version I attempted all on my own. I took every aspect of the previous lightsaber and upgraded it in terms of durability, power, and looks. The electronics for this one feature an Arduino Nano instead of an Uno hooked up to 3 LED strips instead of 2 (One strip is for the side blades). For power, there is a 5V power bank with a much higher battery capacity and the matching voltage for the other electronics. It also features a custom LED button for ignition and a switch to turn the power bank on and off and actual soldering instead of heat shrinks. It also features a custom 3D-printed hilt instead of a cardboard one. Although it was a huge upgrade and was much tougher, it still wasn't as good as I wanted it to be and had a bunch of issues like being extremely heavy.
