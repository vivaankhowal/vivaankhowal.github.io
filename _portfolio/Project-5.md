## About
I've built 2 clocks: one of those was mostly electrical and mechanical, while the other was more of a CAD Design challenge. The one on the right is a Hollow Clock since the actual clock itself is hollow, and the one on the left is a Brake Disk clock: a clock modeled to look like the brake disk of a sports car.

## Brake Disk Clock
This was almost entirely a CAD Design Challenge instead of an electrical or mechanical project. I saw this idea online where other people made theirs by welding metal or using carbon fiber, but I made mine using 3D-printed parts made from various colors of PLA.
